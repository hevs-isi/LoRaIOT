X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2: MEMS Inertial and Environmental Multi sensor shield
#####################################################################

Overview
********
The X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 is a motion MEMS and environmental sensor expansion board
for the STM32 Nucleo. It is equipped with Arduino UNO R3 connector layout, and
is designed around the LSM6DSL 3D accelerometer and 3D gyroscope, the LSM303AGR
3D accelerometer and 3D magnetometer, the HTS221 humidity and temperature sensor
and the LPS22HB pressure sensor.

The X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 interfaces with the STM32 microcontroller via the I2C pin,
and it is possible to change the default I2C port.

Programming
***********

Using the ``x-nucleo-iks01a2`` shield is quite similar to use the shield
``x-nucleo-iks01a1`` for which the :ref:`x-nucleo-iks01a1-sample` application
is provided (see :ref:`shields` for more details).
