Intel S1000 CRB
###############

Overview
********

The Intel S1000 ASIC is designed for complex far-field signal processing
algorithms that use high dimensional microphone arrays to do beamforming,
cancel echoes, and reduce noise. It connects to a host processor chip via
simple SPI and I2S interfaces, to the microphone array via I2S or PDM
interfaces, and to speakers via I2S. In addition, it has an I2C interface
for controlling platform components such as ADCs, DACs, CODECs and PMICs.

System requirements
*******************

Prerequisites
=============

The Xtensa 'toolchain' i.e. XCC is required to build this port. This needs a
license and is available for Linux and Windows from Cadence.

In order to download the installer and the core configuration, users need to
have a registered account at https://tensilicatools.com.

The toolchain installer and the core configuration can be downloaded by following
the links at `Tensillica Tools for Sue Creek`_

Select version RF-2016.4 and download the archive. The archive contains the installer
"Xplorer-6.0.4-linux-installer.bin" and the core configuration "X6H3SUE_2016_4".

For JTAG based debugging, download the XOCD package as well.

A node locked license key can also be generated from the tensilicatools.com portal.

Set up build environment
========================

Run the installer using these commands:

.. code-block:: console

   cd ~/Downloads
   chmod +x Xplorer-6.0.4-linux-installer.bin
   sudo ./Xplorer-6.0.4-linux-installer.bin

Xplorer software will be installed into the /opt/xtensa folder. Please note a dialogue box
should pop-up after running this command. Otherwise, it means your system is missing some
package which is preventing successful installation, most probably gtk2-i686.  You can
install this missing package with:

.. code-block:: console

   sudo apt-get install gtk2-i686

After the tool chain is successfully installed, the core build needs to be installed as
follows

.. code-block:: console

   tar -xvzf X6H3SUE_2016_4_linux_redist.tgz --directory /opt/xtensa/XtDevTools/install/builds
   cd /opt/xtensa/XtDevTools/install/builds/RF-2016.4-linux/X6H3SUE_2016_4
   sudo ./install

"install" is the Xtensa Processor Configuration Installation Tool which is required
to update the installation path. When it prompts to enter the path to the Xtensa Tools
directory, enter /opt/xtensa/XtDevTools/install/tools/RF-2016.4-linux/XtensaTools. You
should use the default registry /opt/xtensa/XtDevTools/install/tools/RF-2016.4-linux/XtensaTools/config.

With the XCC toolchain installed, the Zephyr build system must be instructed
to use this particular variant by setting the ``ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT``
shell variable. Some more environment variables are also required (see below):

.. code-block:: console

   export XTENSA_PREFER_LICENSE=XTENSA
   export ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT=xcc
   export TOOLCHAIN_VER=RF-2016.4-linux
   export XTENSA_CORE=X6H3SUE_2016_4
   export XTENSA_SYSTEM=/opt/xtensa/XtDevTools/install/tools/RF-2016.4-linux/XtensaTools/config/
   export XTENSA_BUILD_PATHS=/opt/xtensa/XtDevTools/install/builds/
   export XTENSA_OCD_PATH=/opt/tensilica/xocd-12.0.4

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing
========

The usual ``flash`` target will work with the ``intel_s1000_crb`` board
configuration using JTAG. Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world`
application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: intel_s1000_crb
   :goals: flash

Refer to :ref:`build_an_application` and :ref:`application_run` for
more details.

Setting up UART
===============

We recommend using a "FT232RL FTDI USB To TTL Serial Converter Adapter Module"
to tap the UART data. The J8 Header on S1000 CRB is dedicated for UART.
Connect the J8 header and UART chip as shown below:

+------------+-----------+
| UART chip  | J8 Header |
+============+===========+
| DTR        |           |
+------------+-----------+
| RX         | 2         |
+------------+-----------+
| TX         | 4         |
+------------+-----------+
| VCC        |           |
+------------+-----------+
| CTS        |           |
+------------+-----------+
| GND        | 10        |
+------------+-----------+

Attach one end of the USB cable to the UART chip and the other end to the
Linux system. Use ``minicom`` or another terminal emulator to monitor the
UART data by following these steps:

.. code-block:: console

   dmesg | grep USB
   minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0

Here, the first command will indicate the tty to which the USB is connected.
The second command assumes it was USB0 and opens up minicom. You can suitably
modify the second command based on the output of the first command. The serial
settings configured in zephyr is "115200 8N1". This is also the default
settings in minicom and can be verified by pressing Ctrl-A Z P.

Using JTAG
==========

For debugging and flashing, you can use a flyswatter2 to connect to the Intel
S1000 CRB.
The pinouts for flyswatter2 and the corresponding pinouts for CRB are
shown below. Note that pin 6 on CRB is left unconnected.

The corresponding pin mapping is

+-----------+-------------+-------------+-----------+
|   S1000   | Flyswatter2 | Flyswatter2 |   S1000   |
+===========+=============+=============+===========+
|     7     |     1       |     11      |    NC     |
+-----------+-------------+-------------+-----------+
|    NC     |     2       |     12      |    NC     |
+-----------+-------------+-------------+-----------+
|     4     |     3       |     13      |     5     |
+-----------+-------------+-------------+-----------+
|    NC     |     4       |     14      |    NC     |
+-----------+-------------+-------------+-----------+
|     3     |     5       |     15      |    NC     |
+-----------+-------------+-------------+-----------+
|     8     |     6       |     16      |    NC     |
+-----------+-------------+-------------+-----------+
|     2     |     7       |     17      |    NC     |
+-----------+-------------+-------------+-----------+
|    NC     |     8       |     18      |    NC     |
+-----------+-------------+-------------+-----------+
|     1     |     9       |     19      |    NC     |
+-----------+-------------+-------------+-----------+
|    NC     |     10      |     20      |    NC     |
+-----------+-------------+-------------+-----------+

Ideally, these connections should have been enough to get the debug working.
However, we need to short 2 pins on Host Connector J3 via a 3.3k resistor
(simple shorting without the resistor will also do) for debugging to work.
Those 2 pins are Pin5 HOST_RST_N_LT_R) and Pin21 (+V_HOST_3P3_1P8).
