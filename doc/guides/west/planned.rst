Planned Features
================

Additional west features are under development for future versions of
Zephyr:

- Running Zephyr in emulation.

- Bootloader integration: bootloader-aware image building, signing,
  and flashing, as well as building and flashing the bootloader itself.

- Additional multiple repository support: fetching and updating repositories
  that integrate with Zephyr, such as `MCUboot`_, `OpenThread`_ and others.
