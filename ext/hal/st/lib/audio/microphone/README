Status:
   version 1.0.0

Purpose:
   This Library is used to decode and reconstruct the audio signal
   produced by ST MEMS microphone (MP45Dxxx, MP34Dxxx).

Description:
   This library, written by STMicroelectronics, is used to convert an audio
   stream from PDM format to PCM format through a signal filtering and
   decimation.

   Library APIs:
      - Open_PDM_Filter_Init()    /* Init the OpenPDM2PCM library */
      - Open_PDM_Filter_64()      /* Filter and decimate stream by 64 */
      - Open_PDM_Filter_128()     /* Filter and decimate stream by 128 */


Dependencies:
   This library depends by Zephyr mpxxdtyy driver and is linked statically.
   This library will be used by a standard Zephyr microphone driver
   (./drivers/audio/).
