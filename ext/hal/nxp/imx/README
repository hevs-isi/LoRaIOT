Status:
   FreeRTOS_iMX7D_1.0.1
   FreeRTOS_MX6SX_1.0.1

Purpose:
   The peripheral driver wrap the H/W

Description:
   This code component is used to add Zephyr support on iMX7 and iMX6SX
   processors, exclusively on Cortex M4 core, and to speed up the development
   process it was decided to have it based on NXP FreeRTOS BSP implementation.

   The i.MX FreeRTOS BSP is split into separate downloadable packages,
   based on SoC. The packages share most of the peripheral driver files
   and here they are combined together.

   The source code was imported from the following folders:
   FreeRTOS_BSP_1.0.1_iMX7D/platform/drivers
   FreeRTOS_BSP_1.0.1_iMX6SX/platform/drivers
   FreeRTOS_BSP_1.0.1_iMX7D/platform/devices
   FreeRTOS_BSP_1.0.1_iMX6SX/platform/devices

Dependencies:
   This source code depends on headers and sources from zephyr:
   ext/hal/cmsis
